1. Board needs to be 50mm x 50mm per 8 channel output

2. Multiple boards should be stackable to daisy-chain multiple units together and provide more outputs
   a. Inputs should be buffered

3. "Active" LEDs should be on the output. Both are supplied from primary external voltage sources.

4. Simplify the hardware interface.

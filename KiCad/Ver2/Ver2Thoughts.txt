1. Perhaps for the board interconnect, use an SMD header thing like what JTAG uses. Somehow the stinkin thing
   needs to be compressed down from the 2.57mm pin headers on the Ver1 prototype.

2. Is it possible to blind and buried vias for a not so expensive cost? 

3. How to make it super easy to stack these things? Maybe allow the board to board interconnects be the 
   smd type that won't even require a cable. Input on the left, output on the right, MCU connect in the
   back output on the front.

4. Probably need to reorganize the shift registers or make models for smaller footprints.

5. Use the standoffs as power distribution solutions.

6. Have power and ground routed on both sides of all connectors. Need multiple injection points.
